In this week I learned:
=Animations:
-Implicit animations: 
                   we use them if our animation does not repeat. For this we have animated types of widgets like Animated Container, etc.

-Tween Builder Animations: 
     			If we dont find a desired animated widget we can make our own custom animated widget using the tween animation Builder.

-Explicit Animation:
			If our animation needs more control then we opt for explicit animations which use an animation controller.
