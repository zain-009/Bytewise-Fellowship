In Week 2:
-I set up the flutter environment on my computer and setup android studio with a virtual device.
-I also learned to use a physical device rather than a virtual device to run flutter app.
-I learned dart programming language and coded using dart.
-I made my first flutter app which navigates from one screen to another using navigator.push().
